## Website

https://gif-capture.herokuapp.com

## Motivation

Original idea was stolen from [@ruffrey](https://github.com/ruffrey) to provide a quick way to insert an animated GIF into chat. Eventually, it would be nice if this tool could be used as a slack app.

## Requirements
* node 8
* npm 6.1.0

Currently uses Firebase and Heroku for the backend

## Usage

Launch a development instance with the following command:

    npm run dev

Navigate to:

    http://localhost:8080

### Known Issues
* Slack, Discord, etc don't have great animated GIF support for `og:image`
* Android support is meh
* Will not work with iOS
* Name is dumb

### Contribute!

Contributions are welcome! Help me make this better!
